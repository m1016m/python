# enstaller configuration file
# ============================
#
# This file contains the default package repositories and configuration
# used by enstaller 4.8.9 for the Python 2.7 environment:
#
#   sys.prefix = 'C:\\Users\\zzjack\\AppData\\Local\\Enthought\\Canopy\\System'
#
# This file was initially created by running the enpkg command.



# `use_webservice` refers to using 'https://api.enthought.com/eggs/'.
# The default is True; that is, the webservice URL is used for fetching
# eggs.  Uncommenting changes this behavior to using the explicit
# IndexedRepos listed below.
#use_webservice = False

# When use_webservice is True, one can control the store entry point enpkg will
# talk to. If not specified, a default will be used. Mostly useful for testing
#store_url = "https://acme.com"

# The enpkg command searches for eggs in the list `IndexedRepos` defined
# below.  When enpkg searches for an egg, it tries each repository in
# this list in order and selects the first one that matches, ignoring
# remaining repositories.  Therefore, the order of this list matters.
#
# For local repositories, the index file is optional.  Remember that on
# Windows systems backslashes in a directory path need to escaped, e.g.:
# r'file://C:\repository\' or 'file://C:\\repository\\'
IndexedRepos = [
#  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/ets/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/GPL-eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
# The Enthought PyPI build mirror:
  'http://www.enthought.com/repo/pypi/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
]

# Install prefix (enpkg --prefix and --sys-prefix options overwrite
# this).  When this variable is not provided, it will default to the
# value of sys.prefix (within the current interpreter running enpkg).
#prefix = 'C:\\Users\\zzjack\\AppData\\Local\\Enthought\\Canopy\\System'

# When running enpkg behind a firewall it might be necessary to use a
# proxy to access the repositories.  The URL for the proxy can be set
# here.  Note that the enpkg --proxy option will overwrite this setting.
#proxy = <proxy string>  # e.g. "http://<user>:<passwd>@123.0.1.2:8080"

# Uncomment the next line to disable application menu-item installation.
# This only affects the few packages that install menu items, such as
# IPython.
#noapp = True

# Uncomment the next line to turn off automatic prompts to update
# enstaller.
#autoupdate = False

# Uncomment to disable pypi eggs
#use_pypi = False
